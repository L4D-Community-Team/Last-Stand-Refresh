# High-Priority-Fixes
Minimalist legacy branch of public repo with gamebreaker and other high priority fixes

# Goal
Files Kerry can diff in under 5 minutes, ~~and implement on a monthly basis~~ probably as a one-time deal since we really don't produce that many high priority fixes.

# Content
See [Hotfix_Update_01.md](https://github.com/L4D2-Community-Update/High-Priority-Fixes/blob/main/changelogs/Hotfix_Update_01.md).

Major gamebreaking bugs such as Last Stand 1's intro death, Dead Center 1's Tank spawn, No Mercy 1's ladder shortcut, and unteleportable permanent stuck spots are the extremely finite focus here.

We also don't want to betray player expectations, so the long-awaited Knife revert is also included. Everything else in this area, such as recolorable SI, is subject to discussion, **but every additional file will further jeopardize our goal**.

We should strive to avoid lump files as they're not as quick to diff, and Valve requires a lengthier verification process for fixes that require source files.
