# Last-Stand-Refresh

Minimalist follow-up patch for [The Last Stand](https://www.l4d.com/laststand/) update.

See the [Changelog](https://github.com/L4D-Community-Team/Last-Stand-Refresh/blob/main/changelogs/Hotfix_Update_01.md) for details about which files are updated.

# Scope

Given the additional risk and lengthier verification of model recompiles, this update includes none. This is a patch made in 2 weeks with a strong focus on text-based fixes that Valve can quickly diff. We do not have C++ access so this limits our fixes mostly to scripts.

We certainly hope to get another shot at this in the future to do more -- just please keep in mind that it is very deliberate that this patch is a small one. A year ago the scope was [much, much smaller](https://github.com/L4D-Community-Team/Last-Stand-Refresh/tree/v01) than you see here.

# Content

Unteleportable permanent stuck spots, the long-awaited knife revert, low shader skyboxes, map QoL and exploit fixes, and a re-balance to The Last Stand single-player are examples of what we address. The bugged Versus Tank spawn on Dead Center 1 has finally been fixed. All Special Infected are now recolorable.
